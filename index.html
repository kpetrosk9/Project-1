    <h2>
    Boston is the place I currently call home. I have lived in Massachusetts almost my entire life, but it wasn't until attending college at Northeastern University that I could truly call Boston home. Boston is truly my favorite city I have visited, and even after living here for 5 years I find that there are always more restaurants, shops, activities, and Red Sox games to go to! I never get tired of the ever changing seasons and the incredible people. This photo was taken out the window of the Liberty Hotel in Beacon Hill this January!

      <h2>
      I moved to Seattle for an internship at Amazon from January to June of 2016. I lived directly across the street from the Space Needle, and walking distance to downtown shops, Pikes Place Market, and Kerry Park, where this photo was taken from. Seattle was an incredible city because there was always so much going on in the city, and a quick drive away there are beautiful mountains for hiking and skiing. I had an incredible six month experience in Seattle and I hope to return soon!

     <h2>
      I have visted Chicago twice now on two short visits, but combined I have come to appreciate what an amazing city it is! My first visit was to see my old roommate that transferred from Northeastern, with 2 other friends. The four of us took the city by storm by going to a Cub's game, out to multiple restaurants and bars, eating deep dish pizza, seeing the bean, and visiting the top of the Willis Tower (where this photo was taken!) Chicago took me by surprise by how beautiful the lake is surrounding the city; and I loved how the river runs right through the middle!

     <h2>
      I visited San Diego for my 22nd birthday! It was only a quick flight from Seattle, where I was living at the time, and a close friend of mine is from the area so a big group of us stayed at his house. San Diego was truly one of the most beautiful places in the US I had ever been. The weather was spectacular, and we took advantage of it by hiking, going to the beach, and eating the best burrito I've ever had in my life! On top of all that, the nightlife in San Diego is amazing; there were so many cool bars and clubs that were right by the beach!

     <h2>
      This past summer I did a Northeastern Dialogue that travelled Greece for 5 weeks. After the dialogue, I stayed in Greece to travel a bit on my own. The place I spent the most time in throughout my time abroad was Santorini. Santorini is a breathtaking island with the most amazing views I have ever seen. The island is made of volcanic cliffs and the white and blue buildings sit high above the ocean. I spent my time there riding ATVs around the island, visiting winieries, tanning on the beach, touring a volcano, and watching the sunset. It was magical!

      <h2>
      Rhodes was the first island I visited in my time in Greece, and the bluest water I had ever seen in my life. The mountains in the distance of the photo are actually the mountains of Turkey, as the beach we were on was only a few miles off the coast of Turkey! Rhodes had some amazing beaches and nightlife, as well as incredible historical value as we spent our mornings touring ancient castles and archeological sites. It was truly an amazing island.

      <h2>
      Crete is the largest island in Greece, and one of the most facinating. It is the closest to Africa, which is incredible because all of the archelogical sites have Egyptian influence. We spent much of our time in Crete seeing the archeolical ruins, hiking the Samarian Gorge, and of course visitng the beaches and eating delicious food! I had the best meal on my entire trip sitting right where the photo was taken. It was the freshest fish I have ever eaten in my life!

     <h2>
     I only visted the island of Symi for about 6 hours but it was truly life changing. It is an island off the coast of Rhodes that you can only get to by ferry boat. They get their water and other resources shipped in each day from Rhodes. It is incredibly remote, and absolutely stunning. The water was the clearest water I have ever seen, and since it was in the Meditteranean Sea, it was incredibly salty so you could just float there without even swimming! We spent the day eating delicious homemade food and jumping into the sea while waiting for our food. It was an incredible day and truly the most beautiful place I have ever been to. Hopefull one day I can go back.

     <h2>
     I visited Athens 3 separate times throughout my time in Europe. It was a main hub that we flew in and out of for all of our travels throughout Greece. When we did get a chance to spend some time out of the airport, Athens was really amazing. The entire city is just built around the beautiful Acropolis (which in Greek means 'hilltop') so you can always see the amazing structure where ever you go! The acropolis was absolutely magnificient and has withstood the test of time. It is an amazing feat of math and science for ancient times, as it is perfectly constructed and uses some very modern concepts in building. From the top, you can see all of Athens below.

     <h2>
    My last stop on my Europe trip this summer was the city of Prague located in the Czech Republic. I wanted to visit somewhere that was essentially completely opposite from Greece. Prague had no beaches, no archelogical sites, no white buildings with blue roofs, but it was somehow the most beautiful city I have ever seen. The architecture in Prague absolutely took my breath away. Every building was different from the last, and the details throughout the city's buildings were incredible. One of my favorite parts about the city is that it is built on a river, and the Charles Bridge that crosses the river, which is pictured here, is an incredible sight with statues and live music and tours all along the way.
